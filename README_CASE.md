CK-Dapper - Dapper with Type mapping support. 
========================================

This implements the code described in this issue https://github.com/DapperLib/Dapper/pull/1802). 
This a NET6 only and strongly named package.

This package should be a temporary one, its version starts at `2.0.124`, one patch above the
Dapper version when this package has been created. When new Dapper versions come out, this pattern of incrementing the patch
will be applied until this capability (in the proposed form or another) is available.

Tests have been removed from the `develop` branch: tests must be the ones in the `dapper/main` 
branch from the https://github.com/DapperLib/Dapper.git repository or in the
Pull Requests branches (like `feature/type-mapping`).
